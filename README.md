README	- this summary file


# Insights :thought_balloon:
When comparing video games in the Sports genre vs. Shooter genre, the global sales average for Shooters is higher than for Sports. However, there are significantly more released Sports games than Shooter games, possibly diluting the sales average. The frequency distribution of video game units sold for Sports games is similar to the frequency distribution of Shooter games but there are a few solo Sports games that sell much more units. In fact, the most game units sold for a Shooter game is significantly lesser than its Sports games counterpart. Despite there being more Sports games, the average Metacritic score for games in the Sports genre is slightly higher than games in the Shooter genre.
