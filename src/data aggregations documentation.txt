# Module 5 Assignment - Aggregating via Count and Average
#
# how the dataset was aggregated for analysis

# 1) Create 2 tables 
#
# average critic score for Sports games as "sports_critic_score"

SELECT AVG(Critic_Score) AS sports_critic_score
FROM sales
WHERE Genre LIKE "%Sports%";


# average critic score for Shooting games as "shooter_critic_score"

SELECT AVG(Critic_Score) AS shooter_critic_score
FROM sales
WHERE Genre LIKE "%Shooter%";


# 2) 3 statistics tables (average, min, max) for global_sales for: 
# 	examples: average_global_sales, min_global_sales, max_global_sales

# ALL GAMES

SELECT AVG(Global_Sales) AS average_global_sales, MIN(Global_Sales) AS min_global_sales, MAX(Global_Sales) AS max_global_sales
FROM sales;


# SPORTS GAMES

SELECT AVG(Global_Sales) AS average_global_sales, MIN(Global_Sales) AS min_global_sales, MAX(Global_Sales) AS max_global_sales
FROM sales
WHERE Genre LIKE "%Sports%";


# SHOOTER GAMES

SELECT AVG(Global_Sales) AS average_global_sales, MIN(Global_Sales) AS min_global_sales, MAX(Global_Sales) AS max_global_sales
FROM sales
WHERE Genre LIKE "%Shooter%";


# 3) Create 2 tables that contain global sales and count for the Sports and Shooter games, respectively

# SPORTS GAMES

SELECT Genre, Global_Sales AS global_sales, COUNT(Global_Sales) AS count
FROM sales
WHERE Genre LIKE "%Sports%"
GROUP BY Global_Sales;

# SHOOTER GAMES

SELECT Genre, Global_Sales AS global_sales, COUNT(Global_Sales) AS count
FROM sales
WHERE Genre LIKE "%Shooter%"
GROUP BY Global_Sales;
